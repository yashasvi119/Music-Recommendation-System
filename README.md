Problem Statement
In today's digital age, despite the vast availability of music, users often struggle to find tracks that match their specific preferences, especially for activities like meditation and relaxation. This challenge stems from the sheer volume of choices and the subjective nature of individual tastes.

Overview
The Music Recommendation System aims to solve this problem by providing personalized music recommendations tailored to each user's preferences. Users can input their preferences through dropdown selections and the system utilizes both user-provided data and automatically gathered information to enhance the accuracy of recommendations. This project leverages various data analysis and machine learning techniques to improve the recommendation process, ensuring that users discover music that resonates with their tastes and enhances their listening experience.

Dataset Details
The dataset used in this project consists of various attributes related to Spotify tracks, including:

Attribute	Description
user_id	A unique identifier for Spotify users, essential for tracking user-specific data and preferences.
Track Name	The name of the track, allowing users to identify their preferred songs.
Artist Name(s)	The name of the artist(s) associated with the track, providing additional context and aiding in artist-specific recommendations.
Album Name	The name of the album to which the track belongs, useful for users who prefer album-based listening.
Album Release Date	The release date of the album, which can help in filtering tracks by release period.
Track Number	The unique track number within the album, assisting in maintaining the order of tracks as they appear in the album.
Track Duration (ms)	The duration of the track in milliseconds, which can be useful for time-based filtering.
Explicit	An indicator if the track contains explicit content, allowing for filtering based on content appropriateness.
Popularity	A measure indicating how popular a track is based on its play count, aiding in recommending trending music.
Added By	The user who added the track to a playlist, which can help in collaborative filtering.
Added At	The timestamp when the track was added to the playlist, useful for tracking the timeline of user activity.
Danceability	A metric describing how suitable a track is for dancing based on tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.
Energy	A perceptual measure of intensity and activity in the track, helping to match tracks to user activity levels.
Key	The key in which the track is performed. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation, useful for music theory-based recommendations.
Loudness	The loudness of the track in decibels (dB), aiding in adjusting for volume preferences.
Mode	Indicates the modality (major or minor) of the track, which can influence the emotional tone of the music.
Speechiness	The presence of spoken words in the track, measured as the ratio of speech-like sounds to music-like sounds.
Acousticness	A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 indicating whether the track is acoustic, useful for users who prefer acoustic music.
Instrumentalness	Predicts whether a track contains vocals. Higher values suggest instrumental tracks, beneficial for background music.
Liveness	Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher values represent a higher probability of a live audience.
Valence	A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track, helping to match music to user mood.
Tempo	Beats per minute (BPM) of the track, which can influence the energy and pace of the music.
Time Signature	The estimated overall time signature of the track, useful for rhythm matching.
Methodologies
The project employs the following methodologies:

Data Collection: Aggregating data from Spotify API and user inputs. This ensures a rich and diverse dataset to base recommendations on.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and structuring the dataset for analysis, which is crucial for accurate and efficient model training.
Feature Engineering: Extracting and refining features relevant to music recommendation. This step enhances the model's ability to understand and predict user preferences.
Similarity Metrics: Calculating similarity between tracks based on various audio features. This helps in grouping similar tracks together for better recommendations.
Machine Learning: Implementing algorithms to predict user preferences and generate recommendations. Machine learning models learn from user behavior to provide more accurate suggestions.
Evaluation: Testing the recommendation accuracy and refining the model. Continuous evaluation helps in improving the recommendation quality over time.
